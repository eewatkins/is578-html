  <h1 style="text-align: center;">A little bit about me:</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I'm an LIS student at the <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/"> iSchool</a> at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I have a cat named Mouse, my favorite colors are pink and brown, and I'm originally from the southwest Chicagoland suburbs.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">In my spare time, I write poetry and I hope to publish a book someday.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Here's an untitled poem I wrote last month:</p>
    <p> </p>
      <p>I’m writing this on my phone because I</p>
      <p>forgot a damn notebook but</p>
      <p>I saw a flock of</p>
      <p>little black birds eating</p>
      <p>on the train just now. it’s no</p>
      <p>wonder people call</p>
      <p>a group of crows</p>
      <p>a murder, though these</p>
      <p>weren’t crows, but anyways the birds</p>
      <p>were so frantic against</p>
      <p>the crop field with their</p>
      <p>pecking that I thought</p>
      <p>there must have been a dead body there,</p>
      <p>a farmer must have spilled</p>
      <p>some seed, and nobody likes to</p>
      <p>think about the fact that birds</p>
      <p>are omnivores. birds eat meat</p>
      <p>and gentle bones aren’t meant</p>
      <p>to be made of meat. when I tried</p>
      <p>to become a vegetarian I slipped</p>
      <p>up and ate a can of chicken soup</p>
      <p>because it was late and I was</p>
      <p>tired. and I was riding pensive</p>
      <p>away in my train car while</p>
      <p>the others were flying, pulling</p>
      <p>the invisible rope around</p>
      <p>the collective away from</p>
      <p>the ground and up towards</p>
      <p>the sky, just</p>
      <p>as frantic, just as mental.</p>
